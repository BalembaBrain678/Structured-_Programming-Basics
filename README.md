#structured_programming_Basics/binary search.c
Input:

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of elements in the array and then the elements themselves.
After entering the array elements, you will be asked to enter the value you want to search for.
Output:

If the key is found in the array, the program will print its value and location (index).
If the key is not found, it will print a message indicating so.
Sample Input/Output:
mathematica
Copy code
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter 5 integers: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter value to find: 3
3 found at location 3
mathematica
Copy code
Enter number of elements: 3
Enter 3 integers: 10 20 30
Enter value to find: 15
Not found! 15 is not present in the list.
Notes:
Ensure that the array elements are sorted in ascending order for binary search to work correctly.
This program assumes that the input array does not contain duplicate elements.
The array size is limited to 100, you can adjust this according to your needs.
The program utilizes the binary search algorithm efficiently, making it suitable for searching large sorted arrays.



#structured_programming_Basics/sum.c
input:

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter a three-digit number.
Output:

The program will compute the sum of the digits of the entered number and print the result.
Sample Input/Output:
mathematica
Copy code
Enter a three digit number: 123
Sum of digits = 6
mathematica
Copy code
Enter a three digit number: 456
Sum of digits = 15
Notes:
The program assumes that the user will input a valid three-digit number.
It calculates the sum of digits by extracting each digit using the modulo operator (%) and then dividing the number by 10.
The sum is accumulated in the sum variable and printed at the end.
This program efficiently computes the sum of digits for three-digit numbers using a simple loop.

#structured_programming_Basics/time_table.c
input:


Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter an integer for which you want to generate the multiplication table.
Output:

The program will generate and print the multiplication table for the entered integer, displaying results from 1 to 12.
Sample Input/Output:
bash
Copy code
Enter an integer: 7
7 * 1 = 7
7 * 2 = 14
7 * 3 = 21
7 * 4 = 28
7 * 5 = 35
7 * 6 = 42
7 * 7 = 49
7 * 8 = 56
7 * 9 = 63
7 * 10 = 70
7 * 11 = 77
7 * 12 = 84
Notes:
The program assumes that the user will input a valid integer.
It generates the multiplication table by iterating from 1 to 12 and printing the result of multiplying the input integer with each number.
The table is formatted nicely for readability.
This program efficiently generates multiplication tables for any integer input within the given range.

7 * 8 = 56
7 * 9 = 63
7 * 10 = 70
7 * 11 = 77
7 * 12 = 84
Notes:
The program assumes that the user will input a valid integer.
It generates the multiplication table by iterating from 1 to 12 and printing the result of multiplying the input integer with each number.
The table is formatted nicely for readability.
This program efficiently generates
